                Desired configuration of a Storage resource. Defines which buckets are
                created under the principal, which external buckets are requested,
                and which grants are issued to other principals.
              properties:
                principal:

                    Unique identifier of the storage principal (typically a user or
                    service account). All buckets, access requests, and grants in
                    this resource are owned and managed under this principal.
                buckets:
                  type: array
                  description: >
                    Buckets to create as part of this Storage. Each entry is keyed by
                    `bucketName`, ensuring uniqueness within the resource. Ordering
                    has no semantic meaning.

                    Each request originates from `spec.principal` and targets a single
                    foreign bucket. The list is keyed by `bucketName`.
